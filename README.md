- It was developed using Java language, JavaFX, and Scene Builder for interface graphics.
- Class diagrams are made with Visual Paradigm.
- For using this project either you can clone it or download it, have installed an IDE(integrated development environment), compile the class called "Main".
### Developer
Fernanda, current student of system engineer at ICESI University, Colombia.
### Explanation of the project
The project consists in the roulette with 4 songs added previously to start the game, you have to log in first and you will obtain 10 points automatically, you will have the option to spin and stop the roulette, and once you know the answer you can say it and win another 10 points! although if you don't know the answer you will have to wait until the current song ends to listen to the next one. <br> However, to help you get points faster, you have 2 polls that simulate `ads` in normal games, since you need 100 points per song.
When you are going to add a new Song you have to put the song in folder res/songs, click on add, and then click on save to keep a register in a txt file of songs added. You can always see the number of points you have currently in your user profile. If you do something wrong you will get messages to help you fix the problem that happens.
## 1. Analysis
Here I begin to do functional requirements and non-functional requirements, in which it's explained in detail all the functions that the program has, and started to make the design of scenarios and test case design. These tests are made with JUnit.
<br>You can see the documents provided for the previous analysis for this project in this [***link***](INFORME.pdf)
## 2. Design
For the design part, I used a UML Class Diagram to show general conceptual modeling of my project.
<br>You can see the design of the project [***here***](resources/data/ProyectoFinal.jpg) and [***here***](resources/data/Interfaz.jpg)
<br> And in these images below: <br> <br>

These are some windows, you can see a roulette and multiple options, but you have to sign in or log in first before accessing some of the other options.
## 3. Presentation (In a video)
You can see the project on action! I will explain the process of doing this project, the data structures, algorithms, methods used for reaching this software, also I will show a little demonstration of the game, playing a song, winning points and so on... <br>
