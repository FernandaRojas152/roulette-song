### Explanation of the project
## 1. Analysis
Here I begin to do functional requirements and non-functional requirements, in which it's explained in detail all the functions that the program has, and started to make design of scenaries and test case design. These tests are made with JUnit.
<br>You can see the documents provided for the previous analysis for this project in this [***link***](INFORME.pdf)
## 2. Design
For the design part I used UML Class Diagram to show a general conceptual modeling of my project.
<br>You can see the design of the project [***here***](resources/data/ProyectoFinal.jpg) and [***here***](resources/data/Interfaz.jpg)
